The process should not take much time. For ex, it should identify the sound and give output in nano-second. The result of AI i.e, the sound event like car-horne or door-bell should be displayed on phone screen in text so that user can read it.

We can create the various sound events list like Alarm, Door Knock, Doorbell, Car Horn, Crying, Dog barking, Gun, Emergency Siren etc. We can set other output modes like vibrating phone, Flash phone light for selected sound events based on its importance.
